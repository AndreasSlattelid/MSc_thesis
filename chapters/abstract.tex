In this thesis, we look closely at the SOFR rates and propose a model for pricing ESG-linked interest rate swaps. There are two ways of calculating SOFR rate averages: arithmetic for 1 month, and geometric for 3 months, we study how this can affect certain hedges and provide a numerical example.

We propose a possible model, modelling a firm's ESG-risk score, and provide a numerical example illustrating the evolution for the fixed ESG-swap rate process $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}$.
