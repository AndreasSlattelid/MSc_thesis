In this thesis, we look at the new SOFR rates and how they differ from the outgoing LIBOR rates. We also propose a model for pricing ESG-linked interest rate swaps. 
\\~\\
We look deeper into SOFR futures and examine the consequences of different underlying calculation methods for 1-month and 3-month futures. This will be further studied in via a particular hedge, where numerical examples are provided.

An ESG-fixed rate process is proposed yielding an expression $\kappa^{ESG}_{t}$ for an ESG-swap rate process. We choose an OU-process $X(t)$ for modelling a firm's ESG risk score. The evolution of the ESG-swap rate process $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}$ is illustrated using a Monte Carlo scheme.
