In this thesis, we look at the new SOFR rates and how they differ from the outgoing LIBOR rates. We also propose a model for pricing ESG-linked interest rate swaps. 
\\~\\
We take a deeper look into SOFR futures and examine the consequences of different underlying calculation methods for 1-month futures and 3-month futures. This will be further studied in a particular hedge, where numerical examples are provided.
\\~\\ 
An ESG-fixed rate process is proposed yielding an expression $\kappa^{ESG}_{t}$ for an ESG-swap rate process. We choose an OU-process $X(t)$ for modelling a firm's ESG risk score. The evolution of the ESG-swap rate process $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}$ is illustrated using a Monte Carlo scheme.      

\begin{comment}
In this thesis, we look closely at the SOFR rates and propose a model for pricing ESG-linked interest rate swaps. There are two ways of calculating SOFR rate averages: arithmetic for 1 month, and geometric for 3 months. We study how this can affect certain hedges and provide a numerical example.

We propose a possible model, modelling a firm's ESG-risk score, and provide a numerical example illustrating the evolution for the fixed ESG-swap rate process $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}$.
