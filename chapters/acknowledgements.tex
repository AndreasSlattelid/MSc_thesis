First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Fred Espen Benth! I would also like to thank my family for their support and continuous encouragement. A special thanks to my sister for extending our family with a new member and providing us with lots of happiness!

Ending up with a master's thesis would not have been such enjoyable if it were not for all the lovely people I've met through my studies! Lastly, I thank Oriol Zamora for the much-appreciated and insightful discussions.
