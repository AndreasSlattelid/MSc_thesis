\chapter{Discussion}

We imposed a model for ESG-linked swaps, which lead to a sequence of fixed rates $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}  = (\kappa_{t}^{ESG}(i))_{i=1}^{n}$ giving a penalty/discount depending on whether the criteria were met or not.
\\~\\ 
We remember that the criteria $A_{i}$ looked like the following:
\begin{align*}
A_{i} &= \{X_{T_{i}} \leq C_{T_{i}}^{ESG}\}    
\end{align*}

This means that our ESG-fixed rate process heavily depends upon the OU-process $X(t)$ and the criteria $C_{T_{i}}^{ESG}$. 
\\~\\
In our modelling approach, we modelled directly under $Q$. However, the market one operates in is under $P$, meaning that it would have been suitable with an Esscher-transform of $X(t)$, which then by  Proposition \ref{prop: Esscher_transform_CPP_Q} means that we would still have a CPP, but with altered intensity $\lambda_{Q}$ and jump-size distribution $F_{J}^{Q}(dx)$.
\\~\\
In our case we have $I(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{N(t)}J_{k}$ with $N(t) \sim Pois(\lambda t)$ and 
$J\sim Exp(\mu)$, and from Lemma \ref{lemma: CPP_exp_mu}, with $\theta \in (-\infty, \mu)$, we have:
\begin{align*}
\lambda_{Q} &= \frac{\lambda \mu}{\theta - \mu} \;\text{and}\;
J \stackrel{Q}{\sim} Exp(\mu - \theta)
\end{align*}

Furthermore, $X(t)$ is company dependent, meaning that to get reasonable estimates of the necessary parameters included, data accessibility is crucial to impose a suitable model. 
\\~\\ 
One should also mention that there are many ESG-rating agencies and different metrics for measuring the ESG score/ESG-risk score. Furthermore, these metrics are not necessarily standardized, which adds to the complexity of modelling a company's ESG score. 


\newpage 
If one looks at the expression $K_{n}^{ESG}(\omega)$: 
\begin{align*}
K_{n}^{ESG}(\omega) &= 
[\kappa -dn]\mathbbm{1}\left[
\bigcap_{i\in \mathcal{I}_{n}}A_{i}
\right](\omega) \\ 
&+ 
\sum_{\alpha \in \mathcal{I}_{2n}^{Even}}
\left(
[\kappa -d(n-\alpha)]\mathbbm{1}\left[
\bigcup_{
j_{1}\neq \dots \neq j_{|\mathcal{I}_{\alpha}^{Even}|}
\in \mathcal{I}_{n}
}\left(
\bigcap_{i\in \mathcal{I}_{n}}A_{i}
\right)^{
\{
(j_{1}, \dots , j_{|\mathcal{I}_{\alpha}^{Even}|})
\}
}
\right]
\right)(\omega) 
\end{align*}

We see that it tracks every path, and for each $n$ there are $2^{n}$-possible paths, meaning that as $n$ increases, the complexity increases. Furthermore, this expression is rather general, meaning that one must rely upon Monte Carlo simulations to get an estimate of $\kappa_{t}^{ESG}(i)$. At the same time, it also gives possibilities for other types of stochastic models for the ESG-risk score.
